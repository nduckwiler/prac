# Getting Started

This README applies specifically to the `csharp-prac` project.

Clone the repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/nduckwiler/prac.git
```

Install Microsoft Visual Studio or dotnet SDK.

# How to use csharp-prac

```
csharp-prac/
|-- Program.cs
|-- Dependencies/
    |-- ...
```
`Program.cs` contains the `Main()` method, which is the entry point for the application. When you click run the application, this method is executed.


## Visual Studio

Open the this directory in Visual Studio. Install dependencies/packages if they prompted to do so. Run the code with Run > Start Without Debugging.

## dotnet SDK

Check that you have the `dotnet` CLI (command-line interface). In your terminal, run:
```
dotnet -v
```

You should see the version printed to the console. If you don't, go back to the dotnet SDK link above and follow the instructions.

Navigate to this directory and run:
```
dotnet run
```
